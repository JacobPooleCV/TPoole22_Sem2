Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n\nLibrary documentation: http://www.numpy.org/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Start below","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**First**, we must **import** numpy from Python!\n\n1.
